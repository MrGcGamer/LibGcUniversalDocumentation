# LibGcUniversal
LibGcUniversal is a universal library for tweak development I made because I think it's annoying to add a new library for every little thing.

## Implementation of a color picker
PreferenceBundle plist (Root.plist e.g.)
```xml
    <dict>
        <key>cell</key>
        <string>PSLinkCell</string>
        <key>cellClass</key>
        <string>GcColorPickerCell</string>
        <key>label</key>
        <string>Your Color Label</string>
        <key>defaults</key>
        <string>com.your.identifier</string>
        <key>key</key>
        <string>YourColor</string>
        <key>supportsAlpha</key>
        <true/>
        <key>safeOnDismiss</key>
        <true/>
        <key>fallback</key>
        <string>ffffffff</string>
    </dict>
```
### supportsAlpha
The `supportsAlpha` property is optional and will default to `true` if nothing else has been specified.

### safeOnDismiss
The `safeOnDismiss` property is optional and will default to `true` if nothing else has been specified.
When `safeOnDismiss` is turned off, the user will have to press the `X` Button in the top right for the color to be saved, when this option is on, the color will be saved even if the color picker was dismissed via the swipe down gesture.

### fallback
The `fallback` property is optional and will default to a clear color if the fallback color hasnâ€™t been set.

You may use any color hex code which condones to one of the following color hex code notations:
 - `rgb`
 - `rgba`
 - `rrggbb`
 - `rrggbbaa`<br/><br/>
The `a` / `aa` (alpha) value has also to be written an in hex and __NOT__ as `:1.0`.<br/>
I recommend using `rrggbbaa`.

### Retrieving a color (example)
Once this is implemented you can then get the chosen color from within your tweak. So an example of how to retrieve the color could look something like this:

```objc
#import "GcUniversal/GcColorPickerUtils.h"

%hook HOOKHERE
-(void)someMethod {
    %orig;

    UIColor *color = [GcColorPickerUtils colorFromDefaults:@"DEFAULTS" withKey:@"KEY"];
}
%end
```

You may also use:
```objc
[GcColorPickerUtils colorFromDefaults:@"DEFAULTS" withKey:@"KEY" fallback:@"ffffffff"]
```
Fallback values have to condone to one of the above-mentioned notations

## Implementation of an image picker
PreferenceBundle plist (Root.plist e.g.)
```xml
    <dict>
        <key>cell</key>
        <string>PSLinkCell</string>
        <key>cellClass</key>
        <string>GcImagePickerCell</string>
        <key>label</key>
        <string>Your Image Labe</string>
        <key>defaults</key>
        <string>com.your.identifier</string>
        <key>key</key>
        <string>YourImage</string>
        <key>usesPhotos</key>
        <true/>
        <key>usesVideos</key>
        <false/>
        <key>videoQuality</key>
        <integer>1</integer>
    </dict>
```
### usesPhotos
The `usesPhotos` property is optional and will default to `true`.
### usesVideos
The `usesVideo` property is optional and will default to `false`.
### videoQuality
The `videoQuality` property is optional and is set to specify a preferred video quality, thus affecting the storage space and quality of the video.
The default value of `videoQuality` is `1`.
Possible `videoQuality` values are as follows:
`0` = high quality
`1` = medium quality
`2` = low quality

### Retrieving an image (example)
Once this is implemented you can then get the chosen image from within your tweak. So an example of how to retrieve the image could look something like this:

```objc
#import "GcUniversal/GcImagePickerUtils.h"

%hook SOMECLASS
-(void)someMethod {
    %orig;

    UIImage *img = [GcImagePickerUtils imageFromDefaults:@"DEFAULTS" withKey:@"KEY"];
}
%end
```

If you want to get the images data instead of the image you can use:
```objc
NSData *data = [GcImagePickerUtils dataFromDefaults:@"DEFAULTS" withKey:@"KEY"];
```

### Retrieving a video (example)
If you decided to let the user pick a video, you can retrieve an `NSURL` leading to it something like this:
```objc
#import "GcUniversal/GcImagePickerUtils.h"

%hook SOMECLASS
-(void)someMethod {
    %orig;

    NSURL *videoURL = [GcImagePickerUtils videoURLFromDefaults:@"DEFAULTS" withKey:@"KEY"];

    if (videoURL) { // this check is to prevent a chrash in case the user didn't select any media
        // do something with the videoURL
    }
}
%end
```
### Getting the media type
In case you give the user the ability to choose a video or an image, you can easily check which one they went for, by doing something like this:
```objc
#import "GcUniversal/GcImagePickerUtils.h"

%hook SOMECLASS
-(void)someMethod {
    %orig;

    BOOL isVideo = [GcImagePickerUtils isVideoInDefaults:@"DEFAULTS" withKey:@"KEY"];

    if (isVideo) {
        // do video stuff
    } else {
        // do photo stuff
    }
}
```
It is also possible to check if the user selected an image like this:
```objc
BOOL isPhoto = [GcImagePickerUtils isImageInDefaults:@"DEFAULTS" withKey:@"KEY"];
```
If you prefer that (though it doesn't make any difference which method you use).

## Getting picker results from Sandboxed processes
If you are hooking a sandboxed app for example, I would suggest using Cephei as it makes preferences, in general, a lot easier when working in sandboxed apps.<br/>
For images, you would probably need to set up some form of IPC, and for a video, I am not quite sure if that is possible at all, without moving it to the apps documents directory due to the fact, that videos are most likely used in an AVPlayer which uses a URL, but the AVPlayer is also going to be restricted by the sandbox and therefore not able to access the directory, where the video will be copied to, by the library, but for colors you can just use cephei like this:
```objc
HBPreferences *prefs = [[HBPreferences alloc] initWithIdentifier:@"DEFAULTS"];

NSString *colorHEX = [prefs objectForKey:@"KEY"];
UIColor *yourColor = [GcColorPickerUtils colorWithHex:colorHEX];
```
## Implementation of a Twitter cell
PreferenceBundle plist (Root.plist e.g.)
```xml
    <dict>
        <key>cell</key>
        <string>PSButtonCell</string>
        <key>cellClass</key>
        <string>GcTwitterCell</string>
        <key>accountLabel</key>
        <string>LabelForTheAccount</string>
        <key>account</key>
        <string>TwitterTagOfAccount</string>
        <key>URL</key>
        <string>URLToAnotherFancyImage</string>
    </dict>
```
### URL
`URL` is an optional value, which can be set, to specify a URL to the image for the account somewhere online.
### Local profile picture
If don't want to use the URL, you will also need to include the profile picture of the account in the `Resources` folder of your preferences.
It is recommended to use a picture with a resolution of at least '200x200'.
The picture will have to have the same name as the Twitter tag of the provided account and be stored as a `.png` file.

## Implementation of a duo Twitter cell
PreferenceBundle plist (Root.plist e.g.)
```xml
    <dict>
        <key>cellClass</key>
        <string>GcDuoTwitterCell</string>
        <key>firstLabel</key>
        <string>LabelForTheFirstAccount</string>
        <key>firstAccount</key>
        <string>TwitterTagOfFirstAccount</string>
        <key>firstURL</key>
        <string>URLToSomeFancyImage</string>
        <key>secondLabel</key>
        <string>LabelForTheSecondAccount</string>
        <key>secondAccount</key>
        <string>TwitterTagOfSecondAccount</string>
        <key>secondURL</key>
        <string>URLToAnotherFancyImage</string>
    </dict>
```
### URLs
`firstURL` and `secondURL` are optional values, which can be set, to specify an URL to the images for each account somewhere online.
If you use the URLs, make sure they link to the images directly. It is also possible to have only one image loaded using the URL and the other one using local files.
### Local profile pictures
If don't want to use the URLs, you will also need to include the profile pictures of the two accounts in the `Resources` folder of your preferences.
It is recommended to use pictures of a resolution of `400x400`.
The pictures will have to have the same name as the Twitter tag of the corresponding account and be stored as `.png` files.

## Implementation of a Social Cell
PreferenceBundle plist (Root.plist e.g.)
```xml
    <dict>
        <key>cell</key>
        <string>PSButtonCell</string>
        <key>cellClass</key>
        <string>GcSocialCell</string>
        <key>userName</key>
        <string>AccountLabel</string>
        <key>subtitle</key>
        <string>someFancySubtitle</string>
        <key>accessoryType</key>
        <integer>0</integer>
        <key>accessoryURL</key>
        <string>URLToAnAccessoryImage</string>
        <key>pfpURL</key>
        <string>URLToSomePFP</string>
        <key>URL</key>
        <string>URLToSomewhere</string>
    </dict>
```
### userName
`userName` is a required value and will be the username displayed on the cell.
### subtitle
`subtitle` is an optional value and will be displayed below the `userName` if specified.
If it hasn't be specified the `userName` will be horizontally centred on the cell. In case you don't want the username to be centred but also don't want to specify a subtitle, you can specify a subtitle only containing whitespace characters.
### accessoryType
`accessoryType` is an optional value, which can be specified in order to display an accessory image (the little image on the right-hand side).
The default value of `accessoryType` is `0`.
Possible `accessoryType` values are as follows:
`0` = none
`1` = Github
`2` = Reddit
`3` = Custom
### accessoryURL
This property is optional and only applies if you chose to set the `accessoryType` to `3` / custom.
Here you can specify the URL to an image will which be displayed as the accessory image
### Local accessory image
If you want to use a local image as the accessory icon, you will have to put it in the 'Resources' folder of your preference bundle and it will have to have the name:`userName.png` where `userName` is the same you specified earlier for display.
### Custom accessory image note
Do note though, that is recommended to provide an image with no clear border on any side, to avoid an unexpectedly small icon.
### URL
`URL` is required and is the URL the user will be lead to, once they tapped the cell.

## Using the helper functions for NSLayoutConstraints
First of all, you will need to import HelperFunction.h as follows:
```objc
#import "GcUniversal/HelperFunctions.h"
```
The `HelperFunctions.h` file includes this interface:
```objc
@interface UIView (extension)
-(void)anchorTop:(nullable NSLayoutAnchor <NSLayoutYAxisAnchor *> *)top
         leading:(nullable NSLayoutAnchor <NSLayoutXAxisAnchor *> *)leading
          bottom:(nullable NSLayoutAnchor <NSLayoutYAxisAnchor *> *)bottom
        trailing:(nullable NSLayoutAnchor <NSLayoutXAxisAnchor *> *)trailing
         padding:(UIEdgeInsets)insets
            size:(CGSize)size ;

-(void)anchorCenterX:(nullable NSLayoutAnchor <NSLayoutXAxisAnchor *> *)centerX
             centerY:(nullable NSLayoutAnchor <NSLayoutYAxisAnchor *> *)centerY
                size:(CGSize)size ;

-(void)anchorEqualsToView:(UIView *)view padding:(UIEdgeInsets)insets ;
@end
```
Therefor you can use the HelperFunctions like this:
```objc
UIView *view = [UIView new];
[someOtherView addSubview:view];

[view anchorTop:someOtherView.topAnchor leading:someOtherView.leadingAnchor bottom:nil trailing:nil padding:UIEdgeInsetsMake(32,15,0,0) size:CGSizeMake(64,64)];
```
Now, this would constraint the `topAnchor` of `view` to the `topAnchor` of `someOtherView` with padding of `32`,
also, this would constraint the `leadingAnchor` of `view` to the `leadingAnchor` of `someOtherView` with padding of `15`,
furthermore, this would constraint the `widthAnchor` and `heightAnchor` of `view` to `64` each.

If you are looking for a better explanation of this function, I recommend watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqpAP7s3b-8&t=840s) video, as it's also where I got the function from, which I tried to convert to Obj-C.

## Using the color utils
Don't forget to import the `GcColorUtils.h`.
```objc
#import "GcUniversal/GcColorUtils.h"
```
The interface in `GcColorUtils.h` looks as follows:
```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, ColorComponent) {
   kColorRed,
   kColorGreen,
   kColorBlue,
   kColorHue,
   kColorSaturation,
   kColorBrightness,
   kColorAlpha
};

@interface UIColor (colorUtils)
+ (UIColor *)closestColorFromArray:(NSArray *)array toColor:(UIColor *)color ;
- (CGFloat)getColorComponent:(ColorComponent)component ;
- (CGFloat)rgbValue;
- (BOOL)isGrayscale;
@end
```
All the functions should be relatively self-explanatory I think, but I will explain a few of them anyways.
The `closestColorFromArray: toColor: ;` function returns the color from the input array, which is the closest to the input color.
The `rgbValue` function returns a float between 0 and 3. This float is calculated by adding the `r`, `g` and `b` values of the color together.

## Using the image utils
Don't forget to import the `GcColorUtils.h`.
```objc
#import "GcUniversal/GcImageUtils.h"
```
The interface in `GcImageUtils.h` looks as follows:
```objc
@interface UIImage (imageUtils)
+ (UIImage *)stockImgForBundleID:(NSString *)arg1 ;
- (UIColor *)averageColor;
- (NSArray <UIColor *> *)dominantColors;
@end
```
### dominantColors
Do note that this function will return an array of colors with an unspecified count, thus meaning you will have to check for the array count manually and you might have to specify different behaviour within your project depending on the number of colors returned.

The rest of these functions should be self-explanatory though, but if you do have a question, just ask me on Twitter or something.
